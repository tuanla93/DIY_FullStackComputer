# DIY_FullStackComputer
The repository is for education purpose.

The purpose of this project is to create a functional computer from hardware up to OS.
The focus will be on Hardware side because I'm an Hardware Engineer... :P

* Hardware part:
The CPU is RISC-V and implemented on FPGA (Ultra96 or similar).
CPU will be verified by SystemVerilog/UVM.
CPU will be benchmarked by (TBD).

* Software part:
It will run Linux (TBD - the simplest distribution)
Just command line is ok, but it should run a simple C program!
